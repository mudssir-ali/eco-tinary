                  natural world on our travels, we were compelled to fight back. But, like so many people, we were
                  overwhelmed by the enormity of the problem and did not know what we could do on an individual level to
                  solve it.</p>
                <p class="jsx-2801606237">So that is why we created the Eco Tinary membership. It is a pathway to
                  action, empowering you to fight back and have a real impact by restoring key ecosystems and mitigating
                  your carbon emissions.</p>

Functioning ecosystems can provide vital ecosystem services such as oxygen production, water purification and flood prevention as well as providing food, medicine and valuable resources. They can also regulate the climate. For example, planting trees can help sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. Restoring predator-prey dynamics can ease browsing pressure on forests, helping support natural regeneration and carbon sequestration.

SeaForester is an initiative that aims to reverse the alarming disappearance of seaweed forests in the world in order to safeguard the oceans’ vital role of carbon sequestration, maintaining fish stocks and securing the planet’s wellbeing. By joining forces with them in Portugal, we aim to make the large-scale restoration of kelp forests a reality here.
